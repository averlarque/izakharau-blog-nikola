One year already passed since I have been promoted to a Product Manager position: first 6 months as an Associate (a Junior grade) and then I stepped in as a fully-fledged Product Manager. And that was a drastic shift that made me revisit some aspects of my work and added a new dimension to my view on product development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this essay, I want to summarize my experience with the insights I collected throughout the year. Some of them might be obvious to a more experienced audience. But for me, some of them were kind of revelations, and some of them were hugely underestimated initially. Anyway, it is a good exercise to conduct such a personal retrospective, and the others, I think, can benefit from that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
