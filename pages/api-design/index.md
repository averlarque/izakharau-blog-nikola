# Overview

In 2022 I started exploring the API design-first approach and dedicated to this topic a series of articles on Linkedin ([1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/api-design-first-series-intro-ilya-zakharau/), [2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/api-design-first-series-why-you-dont-need-ilya-zakharau/), [3](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/api-design-first-series-tools-part-1-ilya-zakharau/), [4](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/api-design-first-series-tooling-part-2-ilya-zakharau/)). I have revised the entire material and published the enhanced version on my blog.

The enhanced version is more structured and has better language. Also, I rewrote some sections for more clarity. If you have already read those articles on LinkedIn, I encourage you to revisit them here.

I decided to choose a more common term, API design, to entitle the series. Because of that, the series with a few articles might get more content in the future.

It will be helpful for those Business Analysts, Product Owners, and Product Managers who want to learn more about API design concepts, tools, and find useful materials to continue the study.
