    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Ilya Zakharau, and I am a Product Manager and Product Owner in a B2B insurtech company. My domain is the Digital Experience: helping teams to quickly adapt product APIs to customer needs and 3rd parties integrations.</p>
<p>I have been writing on my blog for several years already. There was no specific agenda, just what I was interested in at the moment. Since I have streamlined the following topics to focus more on:</p>
<p><strong>API</strong>:
I am working on building and managing transformations in the API layer to adapt the digital experience for specific customer needs. So APIs and everything related is my point of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Low/No-Code</strong>:
I am also working on the low and no-code tooling for the API layer transformations. So I keep an eye on the low/no-code industry as well.</p>
<p><strong>Product Management</strong>:
I am a Product Manager. It is quite a new role, but I would love to share my learnings on that path.</p>
<p><strong>Product Ownership</strong>:
I am also a Product Owner with experience managing a product backlog, refinements, documentation, user stories, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Business Analysis</strong>:
I dedicated a part of my career to Business and System Analysis. Even though I am focused on product management, I am still managing and mentoring business analysts, plus working with the requirements from a higher perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Career Development</strong>:
I am not trying to do career coaching. But I can give some pieces of advice or suggest an interesting reading. For free.</p>
<p>Writing essays is my way to streamline the experience, self-reflection, and information pieces into something structured. Posting helps to improve the quality of text and makes me feel the commitment to a Reader. Also, I enjoy public speaking, but writing allows me to dive into details. I am revising my previous speeches and exploring some topics in written form.</p>
<p>Here are a few additional facts about me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have Bachelor's degrees in Linguistics (interpretation &amp; literary translation - English, and French) and Economics (logistics).</li>
<li>I started my IT career as an L1 Support Engineer back in 2014</li>
<li>Then I switched to a Business Analyst role and worked for five years in outsourcing and product companies on various projects.</li>
<li>Most of my projects and products have been B2B Enterprise related.</li>
<li>I am usually involved in technically advanced endeavors. That is why I have knowledge of Python, SQL, RESTful APIs, etc. My current goal is to learn Go.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find something valuable here. You can also find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilya-zakharau/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ilya_zakharau">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><em>Kind regards,</em></p>
<p><em>Ilya Zakharau</em></p>
