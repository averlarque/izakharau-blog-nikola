Hello,

Welcome to my blog where I publish essays on such topics as business/system analysis, product ownership & management.

Writing essays is my way to streamline the experience, self-reflection, and information pieces into something structured. Posting helps to improve the quality of text and makes me feel the commitment to a Reader. Also, I enjoy public speaking but writing provides a possibility to dive into details. I am taking an opportunity to revise my previous speeches and explore some topics in written form.

So let us get acquainted. I am Ilya and this is a quick summary of my career path: 

* Graduated with a bachelor's degree in Linguistics (interpretation & literary translation) + got the degree in Economics (logistics).

* Started professional career in IT as an L1 Support Engineer in 2014. During that period I spent free time learning Python and tried to develop some pet projects.

* Became a Business/System analyst in 2016. From the start, I worked on implementing and customizing Sharepoint solutions and other Microsoft enterprise products.

* Really wanted to switch to UX. However, I took part in decomposing a complex legacy system into microservices where I became more familiar with back-end and more technical stuff. At some point, I started to own some product directions and acted as a proxy Product Owner.

* Since 2020 working as a Product Owner on an enterprise API Gateway, API building tooling for developers, low-code API solutions.

* Since 2021 acting as a Product Manager for digital experience infrastructure direction in B2B insurtech company.

I hope you will find something valuable here.

*Best Regards,*

*Ilya Zakharau*
