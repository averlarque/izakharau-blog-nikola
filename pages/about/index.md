Hi,

My name is Ilya Zakharau, and I am a Product Manager and Product Owner in a B2B insurtech company. My domain is the Digital Experience: helping teams to quickly adapt product APIs to customer needs and 3rd parties integrations.

I have been writing on my blog for several years already. There was no specific agenda, just what I was interested in at the moment. Since I have streamlined the following topics to focus more on:

**API**:
I am working on building and managing transformations in the API layer to adapt the digital experience for specific customer needs. So APIs and everything related is my point of interest.

**Low/No-Code**:
I am also working on the low and no-code tooling for the API layer transformations. So I keep an eye on the low/no-code industry as well.

**Product Management**:
I am a Product Manager. It is quite a new role, but I would love to share my learnings on that path.

**Product Ownership**:
I am also a Product Owner with experience managing a product backlog, refinements, documentation, user stories, etc.

**Business Analysis**:
I dedicated a part of my career to Business and System Analysis. Even though I am focused on product management, I am still managing and mentoring business analysts, plus working with the requirements from a higher perspective.

**Career Development**:
I am not trying to do career coaching. But I can give some pieces of advice or suggest an interesting reading. For free.

Writing essays is my way to streamline the experience, self-reflection, and information pieces into something structured. Posting helps to improve the quality of text and makes me feel the commitment to a Reader. Also, I enjoy public speaking, but writing allows me to dive into details. I am revising my previous speeches and exploring some topics in written form.
  
Here are a few additional facts about me:

- I have Bachelor's degrees in Linguistics (interpretation & literary translation - English, and French) and Economics (logistics).
- I started my IT career as an L1 Support Engineer back in 2014
- Then I switched to a Business Analyst role and worked for five years in outsourcing and product companies on various projects.
- Most of my projects and products have been B2B Enterprise related.
- I am usually involved in technically advanced endeavors. That is why I have knowledge of Python, SQL, RESTful APIs, etc. My current goal is to learn Go.

I hope you find something valuable here. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilya-zakharau/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ilya_zakharau).
