&lt;p&gt;I fell into a common trap of every manager: obsession with performance metrics. Since I have been promoted to the PO role my responsibilities include tracking stats related to the backlog and team performance. That includes the team’s capacity, estimates, velocity, and other specific metrics. In an ideal world, the estimation of planned features matches capacity, the team performs a predicted velocity and (more importantly) delivers features in time. But we all know that doesn’t work this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how I became obsessed with numbers instead of being obsessed with a product. And how I overcame that and shifted my focus to real value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my career, I participated in the development of a few supplements for so-called “parent” products. They were standalone services with their own, not big, but still considerable business value. Recently I realized that even though those supplement products were developed in different organizations and in different business areas they did have common traits. Moreover, they shared the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was something laying on the surface. Sometimes you shoot yourself in the foot twice before starting to see obvious things. What is the nature of those Sidekick products and do they inherit the problems of “bigger brothers”? Let us sort it out in this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

One year already passed since I have been promoted to a Product Manager position: first 6 months as an Associate (a Junior grade) and then I stepped in as a fully-fledged Product Manager. And that was a drastic shift that made me revisit some aspects of my work and added a new dimension to my view on product development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this essay, I want to summarize my experience with the insights I collected throughout the year. Some of them might be obvious to a more experienced audience. But for me, some of them were kind of revelations, and some of them were hugely underestimated initially. Anyway, it is a good exercise to conduct such a personal retrospective, and the others, I think, can benefit from that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently I was looking for a Junior Business Analyst to join my team. I considered candidates with little or no experience in IT. And that appeared to be a great experience for me. For the first time in my career I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully owned job requirements for the position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made a final decision to hire someone or not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;was not doing tech part of an interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interviewed Junior-level specialists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not the same as interviewing a Middle or Senior BA. There is a wide variety of topics you can discuss with more experienced professionals: practical cases, challenges, techniques, recent articles, etc. But that is hardly applicable for the Juniors as they can share only their background, knowledge of theory with the ability to apply that in practice. At the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

When you are responsible for services widely used by other teams inside and partners outside, you most likely become paranoid about maintaining backward compatibility of your API as much as possible. I had no idea about what backward compatibility means in terms of software engineering until I started working on microservices. Those microservices were important for the organization’s success. And in the same time that was a highly volatile environment with rapidly growing functionality and direction changes on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, I invented the term “backward awkwardability”: when you feel awkward while telling your customers that an upcoming release is not compatible with a previous so they have some work to do. They say something like: “C’mon guys, you introduced breaking changes just a few iterations before! What’s going on?” Ugh, each time I feel sick just remembering those situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are going to talk about the nature of backward compatibility and how to deal with the breaking changes in terms of API.&lt;/p&gt;

At some point in my career, I faced a need to specify requirements for API. Those were not typical solution requirements I worked on before. I learned about the API layer which is very common among the enterprise systems. It can hide a set of microservices or a legacy system from the outer world. Like any other system, it is also impacted by stakeholders' needs. And those needs have to be translated into requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to decompose the definition of API requirements and see what lies within. I will pay your attention to what should be taken into consideration for the API layer. It is an introduction to this topic as there are other sides of it to explore further.&lt;/p&gt;
