There are some changes in the content allocation across my Blog and other social media platforms. That will impact what and where you will see.

**[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilya-zakharau): no more articles, more short posts**

I am no longer publishing any articles directly on Linkedin. There are a few reasons:

-   LinkedIn is not promoting its native articles enough. I did some research and compared the metrics - LinkedIn articles are getting less traction than the posts. I am not chasing the big numbers, but it is disappointing when people don't see good materials.
-   Native LinkedIn articles are not as good at editing and publishing as other platforms.
-   LinkedIn is more about quick "Tik-tok"-like content: short posts and videos, memes, and more generic stuff. It is not a place for longer and more complex articles.

However, LinkedIn will stay as my primary social platform. I will move articles to different platforms but continue publishing links and short posts there.

**[Medium](https://medium.com/@ilyazakharau): my new social platform**

As some of you probably noticed, I published the latest part of the No-code series on Medium (please feel free to subscribe). Now it is a place where I will publish my articles. In a short time, I will migrate there my previous posts as well.<!-- TEASER_END -->

The reason is pretty simple: to attract a new audience. Even though the competition there is high, Medium is a better place for a mid-length reading about professional topics.

**[Blog](https://izakharau.me/): how it will differ from Medium**

My Blog will continue to be a central hub for my content. I will continue to publish some pieces as articles on Medium, then revise and transform them into more comprehensive material available on my Blog only.

Also, the Blog itself will soon be transformed. I keep exploring my areas of interest:

-   product management
-   business analysis & product ownership
-   low & no-code
-   API and integration

Each area will be restructured in the way of a continuously expanding e-book. At least, that is how I see it.

**[Instagram](https://instagram.com/ilya.zakharau?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==): a bit more personal**

Yes, I have an Instagram account. I am not posting much there. But I will keep re-posting stuff coming from LinkedIn and Medium. Sometimes there will be more personal stuff about my hobbies. You can also follow me there.

**[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ilya_zakharau): a proxy**

And I have a Twitter account. Here I am just mirroring the content from LinkedIn and Medium. If you are a Twitter person, you can follow me there to stay tuned.

**Language policy**

Last but not least. English is my content's primary language, even though most of my audience is Russian-speaking. Sometimes I will write posts and share valuable materials written in Russian. But that will happen mainly on LinkedIn.

*Take care,*
