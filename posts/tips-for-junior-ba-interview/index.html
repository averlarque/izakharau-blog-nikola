Recently I was looking for a Junior Business Analyst to join my team. I considered candidates with little or no experience in IT. And that appeared to be a great experience for me. For the first time in my career I:</p>
<ul>
<li>fully owned job requirements for the position</li>
<li>made a final decision to hire someone or not</li>
<li>was not doing tech part of an interview</li>
<li>interviewed Junior-level specialists.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not the same as interviewing a Middle or Senior BA. There is a wide variety of topics you can discuss with more experienced professionals: practical cases, challenges, techniques, recent articles, etc. But that is hardly applicable for the Juniors as they can share only their background, knowledge of theory with the ability to apply that in practice. At the very least.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>The main proof of their ability is a diploma project if they finished some business analysis courses before. Another option is a test task asked to be completed before the interview or even a pet project. And passing the job interview with flying colors, of course.</p>
<p>As I was not hosting the tech part, I focused on the written evidence and carefully listened to the interviewee. After I finalized my feedback for each candidate, I realized some missteps which occurred in a number of the interviews. Even though they seem to be pretty obvious, I think it is important to highlight them and provide my suggestions on how they can be mitigated.</p>
<h3>Invest your efforts in formatting and language of your test/diploma project</h3>
<p>No matter if it is a diploma project from BA courses or a practical task given to you before an interview: you’d better do your best. The first impression is important. You can provide a better experience for the readers and that might become your advantage among other candidates.</p>
<p><em><strong>Author’s flashback</strong></em>:
<em>Many years ago I was helping my mentor with reviewing practical tasks of candidates who applied for a Junior BA position. I was shocked when he refused to read further a document without a table of content so that candidate missed the position. The mentor did not care how good the work might be done in the document. For him, that was one of the criteria to stop wasting time and proceed to the next candidate.</em></p>
<p>From my perspective, it is unfair not to give a chance to a specification with some formatting issues. But that case provides insight into the fact that you never know who will be looking at your spec document and what that person is about on the other side. </p>
<h3>Be able to explain requirements documentation approaches you use</h3>
<p>“We did that because our mentor told us” - is a wrong answer when you are asked to explain why you decided to proceed with user stories instead of use cases in your test/diploma project. You should be ready to justify a used approach considering its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>An interviewer can ask you to compare two different approaches and express your opinion on which is better. The fun part is that there is no right answer. Just share your opinion even if you have not much experience of using both. That is a tricky way to test your real understanding of those techniques.</p>
<h3>If your diploma project is group work, make your contribution clear</h3>
<p>A BA course students tend to write their diploma projects in a group of 3-5 persons. Nothing wrong with that. But for me that makes the assessment of a candidate's skills a bit problematic.</p>
<p>“We did all the stuff together” - a bad answer to a question on how you organized work on the diploma project. That gives me no clue why I should hire you instead of your groupmates. Working in a group of BAs is a valuable skill, but that must be a well-organized process with a clear contribution of each peer. You’d better sign with your name the parts you made and be prepared to explain others’ parts as your own. </p>
<h3>Write your diploma project in English</h3>
<p>If you plan to start your BA career in an international company or company that works with international customers, you’d better write your diploma project in English. As a Junior BA, you are unlikely to be involved much in communication with stakeholders from the beginning. More time you will spend on specifying and documenting requirements. So you’d better provide additional proof of your written English.</p>
<h3>Study different sources of knowledge</h3>
<p>It is painful to hear how a prospective candidate fails to explain the meaning of stakeholder requirements and their place in the requirements hierarchy. I think that happens because most BA students read only the Wiegers* in which stakeholder requirements are not considered as a subject of the requirements structure and implied to be a part of the business requirements. Nothing wrong with Wieger's definition, but you’d better also study BACCM** by IIBA (it is free) and learn the modern industry-agreed standard.</p>
<h3>When you send files don’t use proprietary file formats</h3>
<p>One candidate sent an “eap” file when they were asked to provide an SRS document to prove their BA skills. Once I got that file from recruiters I realized I lack the software to open it on my laptop. I quickly googled that “eap” is an extension for Enterprise Architect files. It is a well-known industry tool but neither I have worked with it nor my organization. So what will my next steps be? To install Enterprise Architect, register, start a 30 days trial, learn how to use it, and finally open that file for a review.</p>
<p>That never happened. I switched to an assessment of other candidates and the content of that file remains a mystery for me.</p>
<p>You can blame me but I value my time and I would like other parties to respect it. Please use common file formats (like PDF, docx, etc) or something that can be opened in a web browser (without mandatory sign-up and providing my credit card information). Remember, as a Junior specialist you compete with several other talented people to get a job. Thus you are not in a position to demand more time than others. Deal with it.</p>
<h3>Do your homework</h3>
<p>Not having questions for an interview or your potential manager is a bad sign. You should prepare some questions about the company, the project/product, team structure, your future responsibilities, organization processes, etc. Don’t be shy to ask any relevant question which comes to your mind.</p>
<p>If it is a product-oriented company then study any available marketing materials about its products and value proposition you find on the Internet. Nowadays organizations are largely investing in content marketing so it is easy to find some hooks that will help you with formulating your questions.</p>
<h3>As conclusion…</h3>
<p>If you haven’t got a job offer after an interview or your application hasn’t been even considered, that does not mean you are a bad business analyst. I would say that in 80% of cases your skills do not fit this particular position. In the other 20%, you might not have done your homework or the interview went surprisingly bad or it was a combination of these factors.</p>
<p>Consider decline as a blessing and keep going. Seek and ye shall find.</p>
